WebAuthn Library
=============

This is a modified fork of [duo-labs/webauthn](https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn) for use with [Aptimex/webauthn-voting](https://github.com/Aptimex/webauthn-voting). It contains modifications and additions that allow arbitrary user data to be signed by an authenticator. See [Aptimex/webauthn-voting](https://github.com/Aptimex/webauthn-voting) for more details.
